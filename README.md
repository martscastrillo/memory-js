# memory-js
<p>This page is the classic memory game, you have to match the two same cards, and keep doing it until you have all of them. When you finish you can restart the game.</p>
<p>The page is worked with mobile first, with a little responsive, so the layout varies depending on the device you use to play.</p>
<p>This website is powered by vanilla JavaScript. I hope you like it.</p>
